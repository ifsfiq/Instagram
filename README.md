## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had a problem with copying a method from an activity class to a fragment class. It was the method for the log out button, if pressed, it went to login activity. The problem that I had when I changed the location of the method was that the method finish() inside the method would not work. I learned from the TA, that fragments do not work the same as activities, so I changed the line from finish() to getActivity().getFragmentManager().popBackStack();. This solved the problem and the method ran properly. I was also confused on implementing a method for the swipe refresh, I fixed it by changing the populateHomeTimeline() method to the queryPosts() method. I also added the line swipeContainer.setRefreshing(false); inside the queyPosts() method and after doing that, the swipe refresh worked!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Some challenges that I faced when building this app was that I had error with my build.gradle, so when I ran the program, it would not work. I fixed this problem by asking a TA's help to
look over my code and see what was wrong. The TA transferred my code to a new project that had no build issues. Another challenge that I had  was that my posts were not being posted. 
To solve this problem, I went to the back4app website and changed the permissions on the post table to read and write to be authenticated. Another problem that I had was that
I had some issues with the Parse library being recognized, so I had to change some of the code in my android manifest file and then it started to work.
